# Automated-web-development-environment
Automated web development using Jenkins, Git/Github and Apache web server.

In this project I used Git/Github, Jenkins and Linux knowledge to make a complete web development environment and integrated all  these technologies to achieve one-to-one automation. For Linux I used RedHat 8. I used Jenkins to connect GitHub and web server hosted in RHEL 8 and automatically launch the server and deploy the website.

 But before beginning with automation part, I first had to setup the environment in GitHub, Jenkins and creating web-server in RHEL 8.
